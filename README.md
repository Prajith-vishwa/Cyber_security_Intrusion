# Cyber_security_Intrusion

**🛡️ Cyber Security Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview**

The Cyber Security Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a machine learning–based application designed to detect malicious network activities and classify them as normal or intrusion attempts.
This system helps improve network security by identifying cyber-attacks such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R attacks using data-driven techniques.
The project integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction using an interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
